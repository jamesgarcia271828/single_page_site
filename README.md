The file `index.html` is a self contained website whose contents you write in
[commonmark] brand [markdown].  Just host it anywhere you can host one file.
I recommend [bitballoon].

You don't need to understand how to build the index.html, you can just edit it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

but if you want to, you can edit the components in `components` and say `make index.html`

Furthermore, if you wanna use `automake` or `bower` or whatever, feel free to add the
capability and make a pull request.
